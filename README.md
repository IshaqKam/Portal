# AdmitCard Generating Portal

This is my first react project. I use Creative tim theme "React-Material-Dashboard" in this project.
Although there are only 2 functionalities in this, But I am still proud of myself that I do this project entirely solo. I am the only member in my group and I did this:-}. If you have any suggestions that you can think can make this project you can tell them to me at ishkam2001@gmail.com. 
Note: Login functionality is still incomplete & Generate pdf is generating pdf but student data is not showing :( So i am still working on these two.

I am listing down some git commands that helps me.
